Absolutely, Trupti! Here's a **targeted interview question set** covering **arrays, pointers, stacks, queues, bitwise operations, and trees**â€”all tailored for embedded systems and Qualcomm-style interviews:

---

## ðŸ”¢ **Arrays**

1. Rotate an array of size `n` to the right by `k` positions in-place.
2. Find the subarray with the maximum sum (Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm).
3. Remove duplicates from a sorted array in-place.
4. Merge two sorted arrays without using extra space.
5. Given an array of size `n`, find the missing number from 1 to `n`.

---

## ðŸ§­ **Pointers (C-specific)**

1. Whatâ€™s the difference between `char *str = "abc"` and `char str[] = "abc"`?
2. Implement a function that swaps two integers using pointers.
3. What is a dangling pointer? How do you avoid it?
4. Explain `const int *ptr`, `int *const ptr`, and `const int *const ptr`.
5. Write a function that returns a pointer to the maximum element in an array.

---

## ðŸ“š **Stacks**

1. Implement a stack using arrays with push, pop, and getMin in O(1).
2. Evaluate a postfix expression using a stack.
3. Check for balanced parentheses in an expression.
4. Design a stack that supports `getMiddle()` in O(1) time.
5. Convert infix to postfix notation using a stack.

---

## ðŸ“¬ **Queues**

1. Implement a circular queue using arrays.
2. Implement a queue using two stacks.
3. Design a queue that supports `getMax()` in O(1).
4. Simulate a task scheduler using a queue (e.g., round-robin).
5. Reverse the first `k` elements of a queue.

---

## ðŸ§® **Bitwise Operations**

1. Count the number of set bits in an integer.
2. Check if a number is a power of 2 using bitwise operators.
3. Swap two numbers without using a temporary variable.
4. Reverse bits of a 32-bit unsigned integer.
5. Find the only non-repeating element in an array where every other element repeats twice.

---

## ðŸŒ³ **Trees**

1. Inorder, Preorder, and Postorder traversal (recursive and iterative).
2. Find the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) of two nodes in a binary tree.
3. Check if a binary tree is height-balanced.
4. Serialize and deserialize a binary tree.
5. Convert a binary tree to its mirror tree.

Would you like me to turn this into a printable PDF workbook or simulate a mock round with 2â€“3 questions from each topic? I can also add Qualcomm-style follow-ups and edge cases to test your thinking under pressure ðŸ’¡ðŸ”¥
