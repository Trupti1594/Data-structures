# Time complexity #
- Time complexity is not the time taken by an algorithm to run on a machine.
- Rate at which the time taken increases wrt the input size.It is the time taken by an algo/operation as a function of input size(n).
- Time complexity is represented in **BIG O notation** O(time taken). This represents the worst case senario or upper bound.For **average case theta()**. For **best case omega**
- Rules are important while calculating the time complexity of any algo
  1) Time complexity ios calculated for worst case senario.
  2) Avoid constants.
  3) Avoid lower values and consider higher values.
